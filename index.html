			<h3>EP Released October 11, 2013</h3>
			<p>Red Dawn’s EP “Antagonist” was released with 5 songs 
			in anticipation of their first self-titled album, 
			expected to be released on November 30. The EP is a 
			provocative, challenging collection of strong lyrics and 
			complex melodies. It’s temporarily available for free 
			download on Noisetrade.</p>
			The songs:
			<ol>
				<li>Slowly Fading Out</li>
				<li>B2B (Back to Basics)</li>
				<li>Last Call</li>
				<li>Lonely Cosmonaut</li>
				<li>Antagonist</li>
			</ol><br>
			<h3>Music Video Debut! Live Acoustic Sessions with Dawn</h3>
			<p>Dawn Kafka was recently featured on WYMS 88.9 Radio 
			Milwaukee. She performed “Antagonist” live on the air. 
			The producers recorded a video of her and posted it to 
			their YouTube channel.	Dawn said of the album, “We aim 
			to do more than inspire. We aim to challenge. Our music 
			is written with… much time and intention. Each word is 
			constructed to get across the message that, yeah, life 
			is hard, but we can defeat its attempts to stomp us out.
		   	We have a voice that can be heard.”
			<br>Radio Milwaukee will regularly be playing “Antagonist”
			on the air. Be sure to tune in!</p><br>
			<h3>Guerrilla Concert a Success</h3>
			<p>Red Dawn met in a subway and performed “Last Call” on 
			October 4th. Their “guerrilla concerts” - an original 
			concept in which the band tweets hints of location and 
			time of a song performance - had lift off last August, 
			and since then have attracted fans nationwide.
			<br>“It’s exciting,” said one fan at the performance on 
			Friday. “There’s a mystery to solve with such an awesome 
			ending. You can’t always solve the puzzle, but there’s 
			an amazing sense of accomplishment and belonging when
		   	you do.”

						<h3>Red Dawn Steampunk Rock</h3>
						<p>A revolutionary roar inspiring the people 
					   	to rise up and rock</p>
						<p>Red Dawn began in the motherland. Each 
						member of Red Dawn was born in the former 
						Soviet Union shortly before, or just after, 
						Chernobyl’s nuclear disaster and each dealt 
						with the consequences in different ways. 
						Enduring losses and overcoming them, they each felt 
						a righteous anger and passion for a memorable, 
						victorious life.<br>In the early 2000s, they all 
						immigrated to Manhattan, New York, USA. Fate 
						brought them together working a blue collar 
						job at a steel factory. Realizing their 
						common roots and mutual love of music, they 
						bonded together. They found a home in the 
						steampunk culture and used their knowledge of 
						metals and music to create custom-made, 
						one-of-a-kind steampunk instruments.<br>Red 
						Dawn is led by Dawn Kafka, contributing lead 
						vocals and acoustic guitar. Gregor Kozlov is the
						mind-bending genius	behind Red Dawn's electric 
						guitar and writer of many of the band's songs. 
						Bito Buzinsky backs Red Dawn with face-melting percussion. 
						Taryn Mills provides lilting background 
						vocals and a dreamlike upright bass. 
					   	Dimah Dimitri lays down his sublime voice as backup vocalist. 
						Finally, Danil Olkhovsky is Red Dawn's remixing 
						master and backup percussionist.<br>
						Red Dawn’s latest and self-titled first album is a masterpiece 
						of its own species. You have found the official site. Welcome.<br>
						Let’s rise up and rock.

						<h3>Dawn Kafka, guitarist and lead singer</h3>
						<p>age: 28</p>
						<p>Dawn was born in the heart of 
						Chernobyl in a lower class family, days before 
						the disastrous explosion. They quickly moved 
						to St. Petersburg. Despite this, she began 
						work at 9 years old, repairing instruments at 
						her father's shop to help earn money for her 
						family. By the time she was 12, she was 
						building guitars and drum sets from the 
						ground up, and knew how to skillfully play
						13 different instruments. At age 15, 
						her family moved to the Americas to 
						start a better life and to receive medical 
						treatment for Dawn not available in Russia.
						Dawn continued her passion in music, and she 
						became a metalworker at 19 years old to earn 
						a steady income. There, she met the rest of her 
						band, and they found their similarities in 
						struggles and music bonded them on a strong
						level.</p>
						<p>Battling poverty and being an outsider 
						most of her life because of her illness, 
						Dawn finds inspiration in the struggles she once 
						endured. She believes that every person has 
						the opportunity to rise up, but knows they are 
						often wrongfully pushed aside. Through Red 
						Dawn, her goal is to inspire the forgotten to 
						make a name for themselves and be remembered.

						<h3>Gregor Kozlov, songwriter and electric guitar</h3>
						<p>age: 22</p>
						<p>The thundering electric guitar responsible for 
						laying down Red Dawn’s gritty steam-punk 
						inspired style, Gregor was born and raised 
						in the small city of Kozlovka, Kozlovsky 
						District, Chuvash Republic. Gregor is 
						also responsible for co-writing and 
						co-producing many of the band’s songs. From 
						a young age Gregor always gravitated towards 
						music with a message, with bands like
						<em>The Clash</em> and <em>The Ramones</em>
						being a huge influence on him. After 
						graduating from High School, Gregor took a 
						year off to tour Europe and Asia, taking 
						any odd jobs possible and playing music at 
						various clubs and bars on his way. Upon his 
						return to Kozlovka, Gregor made the decision 
						to move to the United States in order to 
						further his education with a focus on art 
						and music. There, he met the rest of his 
						band mates in what could only be described 
						as destiny. The rest is history…

						<h3>Bito Buzinsky, drummer</h3>
						<p>age: 31</p>
						<p>I was born in Vorkuta of the Komi
						Republic, which had a population of 70,551
						at the time. I was the one. This number has
						meaning to me since	I am an only child. 
						I was born on January 1st 1981, I am 31 years
						old and I am the only one in my family to 
						leave Russia and live in America. When I was
						a young boy my father worked as a metal
						worker in a factory. He taught me everything 
						he knew about metal working, which is why I 
						made my drum set from scrap metal. After 
						moving to America I got a job working as a
						metal worker, like my father, in a metal 
						factory in Manhattan where I met my band 
						members. We always would talk to each other 
						during breaks and found out that we all 
						played an instrument or could sing. One day
						after work we decided to get together and 
						play music just for fun. The music sounded 
						great so we decided to become a band. Later,
						we came up with the name Red Dawn. </p>

						<h3>Dimah Dimitri, backup vocals</h3>
						<p>age: 29</p>
						<p>Dimah was born in 1984 in Chernobyl, 
						Soviet Union Russia where his family worked 
						at the local iron foundry. When Dimah was at 
						the young age of a year and a half his family 
						decided to move to Manhattan, New York to seek
						better Iron foundry opportunities, fortunately 
						for them they avoided one of the world’s worst 
						nuclear accidents in history.  Growing up Dimah 
						was interested in music and using different 
						objects to make music. In his teen years he 
						fell in love with the rhythm of music and how 
						different harmonious sounds came together to make
						beautiful music. In high school Dimah was part 
						of the church choir, which made him feel like he 
						was a part of something bigger than himself. 
						After high school he felt a void in his life, 
						wanting again to be a part of something bigger. 
						While working with his family at the iron foundry
						he met several other individuals trying to start 
						a band but seemed to be missing that rhythm they 
						hoped for. Dimah offered to be part of the band 
						and suggested that a back ground singer would 
						give the band that extra beat they needed. 
						Dimah was a perfect fit for the band which is 
						now on its first tour of the country. </p>

					<h3>Danil Olkhovsky, mix master and backup percussion</h3>
					<p>age: 29</p>
					<p>I was born November 8th, 1984 in Ufa, 
					Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia. Growing 
					up in Ufa was difficult but rewarding. 
					From a young age, I found myself fascinated with 
					electricity and electronics. However, my 
					family rarely had extra money for technology. 
					To satisfy my curiousity, I learned to take apart 
					and repurpose the things others had thrown away. 
					This would have probably led to a very intersting 
					career in computer repair, unfortunately, due to 
					the Chernobyl incedent I could not find any work locally. 
					Despite this obstacle, I continued following my curiosity. 
					I saw how electronics could be used to make and blend 
					music, and before graduating high school I sucessfully 
					built my first sound mixer. My family and I 
					decided to emigrate to the United States in 2002, 
					hoping for a more secure future. In Manhattan, New York,
					I took on a job as a metal worker to earn a steady
					income. After a few years at my job, I met the 
					rest of the band. We all quickly bond with our common past 
					and struggles, and I decided to try my hand at mixing
					an entire group. I couldn't be happier 
					with the results, and I know you will be too.
