						<h3>Dawn Kafka, guitarist and lead singer</h3>
						<p>age: 28</p>
						<p>Dawn was born in the heart of 
						Chernobyl in a lower class family, days before 
						the disastrous explosion. They quickly moved 
						to St. Petersburg. Despite this, she began 
						work at 9 years old, repairing instruments at 
						her father's shop to help earn money for her 
						family. By the time she was 12, she was 
						building guitars and drum sets from the 
						ground up, and knew how to skillfully play
						13 different instruments. At age 15, 
						her family moved to the Americas to 
						start a better life and to receive medical 
						treatment for Dawn not available in Russia.
						Dawn continued her passion in music, and she 
						became a metalworker at 19 years old to earn 
						a steady income. There, she met the rest of her 
						band, and they found their similarities in 
						struggles and music bonded them on a strong
						level.</p>
						<p>Battling poverty and being an outsider 
						most of her life because of her illness, 
						Dawn finds inspiration in the struggles she once 
						endured. She believes that every person has 
						the opportunity to rise up, but knows they are 
						often wrongfully pushed aside. Through Red 
						Dawn, her goal is to inspire the forgotten to 
						make a name for themselves and be remembered.

						<h3>Bito Buzinsky, drummer</h3>
						<p>age: 31</p>
						<p>I was born in Vorkuta of the Komi
						Republic, which had a population of 70,551
						at the time. I was the one. This number has
						meaning to me since	I am an only child. 
						I was born on January 1st 1981, I am 31 years
						old and I am the only one in my family to 
						leave Russia and live in America. When I was
						a young boy my father worked as a metal
						worker in a factory. He taught me everything 
						he knew about metal working, which is why I 
						made my drum set from scrap metal. After 
						moving to America I got a job working as a
						metal worker, like my father, in a metal 
						factory in Manhattan where I met my band 
						members. We always would talk to each other 
						during breaks and found out that we all 
						played an instrument or could sing. One day
						after work we decided to get together and 
						play music just for fun. The music sounded 
						great so we decided to become a band. Later,
						we came up with the name Red Dawn. </p>

						<h3>Dimah Dimitri, backup vocals</h3>
						<p>age: 29</p>
						<p>Dimah was born in 1984 in Chernobyl, 
						Soviet Union Russia where his family worked 
						at the local iron foundry. When Dimah was at 
						the young age of a year and a half his family 
						decided to move to Manhattan, New York to seek
						better Iron foundry opportunities, fortunately 
						for them they avoided one of the world’s worst 
						nuclear accidents in history.  Growing up Dimah 
						was interested in music and using different 
						objects to make music. In his teen years he 
						fell in love with the rhythm of music and how 
						different harmonious sounds came together to make
						beautiful music. In high school Dimah was part 
						of the church choir, which made him feel like he 
						was a part of something bigger than himself. 
						After high school he felt a void in his life, 
						wanting again to be a part of something bigger. 
						While working with his family at the iron foundry
						he met several other individuals trying to start 
						a band but seemed to be missing that rhythm they 
						hoped for. Dimah offered to be part of the band 
						and suggested that a back ground singer would 
						give the band that extra beat they needed. 
						Dimah was a perfect fit for the band which is 
						now on its first tour of the country. </p>

						<h3>Gregor Kozlov, songwriter and bass</h3>
						<p>age: 22</p>
						<p>The thundering bass responsible for 
						laying down Red Dawn’s gritty steam-punk 
						inspired style, Gregor was born and raised 
						in the small city of Kozlovka, Kozlovsky 
						District, Chuvash Republic. Gregor is 
						also responsible for co-writing and 
						co-producing many of the band’s songs. From 
						a young age Gregor always gravitated towards 
						music with a message, with bands like
						<em>The Clash</em> and <em>The Ramones</em>
						being a huge influence on him. After 
						graduating from High School, Gregor took a 
						year off to tour Europe and Asia, taking 
						any odd jobs possible and playing music at 
						various clubs and bars on his way. Upon his 
						return to Kozlovka, Gregor made the decision 
						to move to the United States in order to 
						further his education with a focus on art 
						and music. There, he met the rest of his 
						band mates in what could only be described 
						as destiny. The rest is history…
